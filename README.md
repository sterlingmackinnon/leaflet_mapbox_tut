# Leaflet.js or Mapbox.js Simple Map Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will be working with sample geodata to build a simple map using Leaflet.js and use the same data to build one using Mapbox.js. This will highlight some areas of how Mapbox.js builds on top of Leaflet.js and have a session discussing their uses either or using these tools for different purposes. 

The comments and discussions would help iterate this tutorial further to clarify the uses/similarities/differences of these tools for everyone.
